Problem Set 1
1) Miocene: 602, Early Jurassic: 169, Cretaceous: 375, Pennsylvanian: 133 > apply(PresencePBDB, 1, sum)
2) 29 > dim(PresencePBDB)
3) Pridoli, Early Devonian, Cisuralian, Late Jurassic, Eocene, Late Cretaceous, Early Cretaceous, Middle Jurassic, 
Paleocene, Oligocene, Miocene, Early Jurassic, Pleistocene, Middle Triassic, Late Triassic, Pliocene, Early Triassic 
> PresencePBDB[,"Mytilus"]
4) Middle and Late Devonian, Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, Guadalupian, Lopingian. Mytilus is present before and after these epochs.

Problem Set 2
To generate a Jaccard similarity index of the Miocene and Pleistocene samples, I would take the sum of the genera that are common between both time periods and divide by the total sum of genera present in both time periods.  To make it into an index of dissimilarity I would use the some of genera unique to each time period in the numerator and leave the denominator the same.
1) 0.8279221
2) 1-(Jaccard index) or the number of genera that occur in only one of the epochs divided by the total number of genera.
3) > vegdist(PresencePBDB[c("Miocene", "Pleistocene"),], method = "jaccard")
              Miocene
Pleistocene 0.1720779
4) > vegdist(PresencePBDB[c("Miocene", "Pleistocene", "Pliocene", "Oligocene", "Eocene", "Paleocene"),], method = "jaccard")
The Paleocene and Pleistocene are most dissimilar. 0.444

Problem Set 3
To find the epochs that are the most dissimilar the index of dissimilarity would be closer to 1, so the two epochs with the highest index would be compared.  The high index of dissimilarity between the early Cretaceous and Paleocene epochs is likely due to the K-T mass extinction event.
1) > RandomEpochs<-PresencePBDB[c("Pliocene", "Oligocene", "Paleocene", "Early Cretaceous", "Late Jurassic", "Middle Jurassic"),]
2) > vegdist(RandomEpochs, method = "jaccard")
                  Pliocene Oligocene Paleocene Early Cretaceous
Oligocene        0.1896839

Middle Jurassic      0.2962963
3) Pliocene, Oligocene, Paleocene, Early Cretaceous, Late Jurassic, Middle Jurassic
4)It seems to be in reverse chronological order which makes sense that genera become more dissimilar over time given that species become extinct and new species radiate into that open ecological space.
5)K-Pg event decimated the large terrestrial and marine fauna roughly 65 mya.
