6. 11.3% decrease K-Pg event!  Yes, there is less diversity in the Paleocene than the Late Cretaceous according to my calculations using Shannon's entropy.
7. 43.7% decrease, I think this value better reflects the loss of biodiversity because it was a mass extinction followed by an adaptive radiation of (mostly) mammals, so one would expect a large amount of ecological niches to be opened up.
