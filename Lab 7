Problem Set 1
1) min_ma "at least this many million years old", max_ma "no more than this many million years old"
2) > tapply(DataPBDB[,"max_ma"], DataPBDB[,"genus"], max)
3) > tapply(DataPBDB[,"min_ma"], DataPBDB[,"genus"], min)
4) Anadara, > sort(table(DataPBDB[,"genus"]))
5) 0-66 Ma, > Anadara<-subset(DataPBDB, DataPBDB[,"genus"]=="Anadara")
> max(Anadara[,"max_ma"])
[1] 66
> min(Anadara[,"min_ma"])
[1] 0

Problem Set 2
1) mean(sample(Lucina[,"paleolng"],length(Lucina[,"paleolng"]),replace=TRUE))
> #mean finds the average of the data, sample takes numbers from a pool of data in this case the paleolng column of the Lucina dataset, length uses the length of that vector, replace=TRUE means a datapoint may be sampled more than once
2) > plot(density(ResampledMeans))
It looks approximately Gaussian.  It has the distinctive bell curve shape of a normal distribution.
3) > mean(ResampledMeans)
[1] 24.16227
It's pretty close.
4) > sort(ResampledMeans)
5) 2.5th percentile: 21.81826, 97.5th percentile: 26.2861
> SORTED<-sort(ResampledMeans)
> SORTED[25]
[1] 21.81826
> SORTED[975]
[1] 26.2861
6) This gives us an interval of 95% which is one of the most commonly used confidence intervals in statistics.

Problem Set 3
1) Likely, I'm 95% sure.
2) > Dallarca<-subset(DataPBDB, DataPBDB[,"genus"]=="Dallarca")
> estimateExtinction(Dallarca[,"min_ma"],0.95)
Earliest   Latest 
 2.58800 -3.88749
3) Based solely on the confidence interval, yes, but I'm a human being which means I'm smarter than R.
4) I would trust the fossil record because we know that Dallarca is no longer around, and the last evidence for it is at the beginning of this confidence interval.

Problem Set 4
1) Species are not randomly distributed throughout the world; they exist in a geographic range that corresponds to their realized niche.
2) The geological record is not random; the strata are in chronosequence.

Problem Set 5
1) 67617, 59096, 8521 lost
2) 1018, 532, 52.3%
3) tapply(ExtantData[,"min_ma"], ExtantData[,"genus"], min)
tapply(ExtantData[,"max_ma"], ExtantData[,"genus"], max)
4) 
5)
