#1. 10 different species

> You did not state which specimens belong to which species! - 1 points

#2. based on ridges, shape of cross section(circular or square), appearance of "coiling" pattern

#3. Some of the ammonites appear to be miniature versions of one of the larger specimens.

> Fair enough, but you could have read about the degree of coiling, -0.5 points

#4. Looked at the width of the shells since it has been established females tend to be larger.

#PART 2
#1. Land, links, site, species, outline

#2. character

> The correct answer is array, matrix, factor, factor, matrix, -0.5 points

#3. I can't.

> dim(plethodon[["land"]]), -0.5 points

#Subsection 2
#1. land

#2. ok

> What code did you use? -1 points

#3. you got it!

> How did you do it? -1 points

#4. There is either one with a lot of variation or 10+ species that are very closely related.

> Based on what?

#PART 3

#1. Fangs longer than 6 inches

#2. Sulfurous odor

#3. Adorable eyelashes

#4. C, D, E

#5. Laser death ray in species E

#6. Synapomorphy

#7. Family 1 - monophyletic, Family 2 - polyphyletic, Family 3 - monophyletic

#1. No, that would be a paraphyletic group since B shares a more recent common ancestor with A, and C with D and E.

#2. Group 1 - para, Group 2 - mono, Group 3 - para, Group 4 - mono, Group 5 - poly

#PART 4

#1. paedomorphosis
