Problem Set 1
1) > dim(MacroPBDB)
[1] 9013   13
> dim(DataPBDB)
[1] 34166    26
> 34166-9013
[1] 25153
2) These are likely only North American occurences since the coverage of Macrostrat is limited to North America.

Problem Set 2
1) > CandidateUnits<-c("Chancellor", "Kinzers Fm", "Stephen Fm", "Marjum Limestone", "Wheeler Shale", "Langston Fm", "Weymouth Fm", "Snowy Range Fm", "Parker Slate", "Forteau Fm")
2) > GenusFrequencies<-apply(GenusMatrix, 2, sum)
3) > barplot(table(GenusFrequencies))
4) Hollow curve
5) > RareGenera<-GenusFrequencies[GenusFrequencies<=median(GenusFrequencies)]

Problem Set 3
1) > CandidateMatrix<-GenusMatrix[CandidateUnits,]
2) Weymouth Fm, Chancellor, Forteau Fm, Marjum Limestone
These sites have a higher percentage of shared genera with the list of rare genera.
3) Chancellor Basin!!! The Burgess Shale! I KNEW IT! It contains a large number of soft-bodied animals.  It gives us a rare glimpse at types of organisms present during the Cambrian that are not preserved elsewhere.
