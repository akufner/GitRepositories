####Cenozoic latitudinal response curves: individualistic changes in the latitudinal distributions of marine bivalves and gastropods By: Andrew A. Zaffos and Arnold I. Miller

###Summary
This paper intended to show how ecological gradients can cause the distribution of genera to change away from the equator. `(Do you still think that this was the intent of the paper after class discussion?)`  All of the statistics, however, showed that there was no preferential direction for shifts in geographic distribution of the marine bivalves and gastropods in question. `(Is this strictly true?)`  They offered several explanations for these results that are quite different from those of similar studies.  These included sampling issues, genuine equatorward migration, time averaging effect due to coarse temporal scales, and bridge species expanding both equatorward and poleward.  It then went on to explain the significance of ubiquitous hollow curves for the preferred latitude and latitudinal tolerance of genera in different epochs which I had a difficult time following.
> Reading from the primary literature is always somewhat challenging, but it is generally worth the effort! Hopefully as the course goes along you will pick up more tools to help you in that process.

To be honest, there was not much I liked about this paper.  The fact that they were able to quantify ~~this~~ these data so well is one thing that I do like about the paper.  I also like that they had such a large sampling size.  This makes the results more reliable for me.  I would like to learn a little bit about the statistical methods used, but I feel that would be better reserved for an actual statistics course.  It was also interesting to see the different explanations for why the results were not was expected.
> Be careful what you wish for when it comes to actual statistics courses! I have found that focusing too much on methods, rather than scientific questions/hypotheses and data, can make learning the methods even harder. It is also true that without a grounding in some general methods, diving into a paper like this can be difficult. Again, hopefully you pick up some tools that make it easier to dive into the primary literature by the time the course is over!

Overall, I did not like this paper.  I found it completely uninteresting and difficult to get through.  I really have no interest in geographic distributions of species or genera or any other taxonomic value. `(Interesting! Geographic range is often described as a fundamental property of groups of living things that is of great importance in determining such factors as potential extinction risk, economic/ecological impact, etc. So, if not geographic range, what are you interested in?!)`  Maybe I do not have the background to make sense of what is trying to be communicated in the paper.  I do not see the importance of this research, and I do not think it was stated anywhere in the paper what value this kind of research can impart.  I also found it very difficult to follow.  There were so many things I have never been exposed to in any class or real world situation.  I was in my seminar class less than a week ago, and we were talking to a population geneticist about quantitative methods used in studying evolution.  One of the most striking things for me is that, as undergraduates, we are not exposed to any of the rigorous statistical methods used in most research.  Most of us are lucky to understand what T-test is or a Poisson distribution.  I had never heard of Bayesian methods until about a year ago, and I still have no idea what is going on there.  The methods used here seem simple enough, but I could never tell you why they are used.  Given enough time I might be able to make some more sense of it, but I feel like my college education has not prepared me for an actual career in any kind of science.  Now that my rant is over let’s talk about the figures.
> This is good! You should bring these issues up in class whenever you feel it is relevant. We certainly have the ability to plug some of the holes you feel are present during this course, but not being afraid to point them out is the first step there! That said, I would very suprised (and in fact, very skeptical) if you dived into any paper in the primary scientific literature and claimed you "got it all." At this stage, I would expect you to struggle, and even if you study for years and years, reading (and writing) takes serious effort. So, don't get frustrated!

Overall, the figures were foreign to me.  I recall talking about hollow curves in lecture, and I read over their significance in the paper, but I am still very confused.  Figure 1 was definitely the most straightforward and easy to understand.  I can very clearly see the latitudinal gradient proposed by the hypothesis.  Figure 2 is terribly confusing.  I understand Pearson’s r value and degrees of freedom and p-values and linear regression, but the layout is bizarre.  I could not tell you which graph goes with which set of data.  Maybe it does not matter because they all look the same, but I prefer clarity.  From Figure 3 it looks like almost no taxa shifted in preferred latitude or latitudinal tolerance if I am reading it correctly.  Table 1 seems straightforward, but I still do not know what bootstrapping is.  I even have to deal with it for my research project, and I have read about it.  Figure 4 is basically the same to me as 3.  Then Figure 5 helps me to understand the disproportionate sampling mentioned in the discussion about why the results do not show any poleward expansion.
> I agree that there were a few aspects of the Figures that were dense, but they also had the advantage of conveying a great deal of information in a very little space, which is one of the objectives of scientific illustration. It usually takes a few moments of studying the figure, reading the caption, and going back to the text description to get everything out of the analysis and results that are presented in most figures/tables.
